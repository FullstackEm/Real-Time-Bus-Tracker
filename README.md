# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
MIT Pro Assignment
This is a copy of the assignment for creating a map animation. The improvement I made was changing the color of the marker from the default blue to green.
How to Run: click on the button at the top left to activate the marker animation to move from MIT to Harvard along the bus route.
Roadmap of future improvements: As my development skills improve, I would like to learn how to add a search bar and make the webpage more appealing.
